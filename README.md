# Twitch Framework x JS 

TFxJS is an advanced tool for creating bots on the Twitch platform. It aims to simplify event management, Twitch API integration and command handling, allowing developers to focus on implementing the bot's core logic. The framework provides an intuitive structure, modularity and easy configuration, making it an ideal choice for both novice and advanced bot developers.

## Features

- **Easy integration with Twitch API** - ready-to-use modules for easy connection with Twitch API REST and WebSocket.
- **Event handling** - the framework automatically handles events related to chat, users and (soon) much more!
- **Command and Listener System** - ability to define custom commands and listeners, manage them easily.
